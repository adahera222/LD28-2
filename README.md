My entry for ludum dare 28.  Theme: You Only Get One

This is made in Python using pygame, you will need
both installed to run this game

You only get one bullet.

However, it will return to you, after it comes back you can shoot it again.  You can control its movements along with your ships, optimize how it bounces off enemies to clear as many as possible.

If you have an Xbox 360 controller use the dpad to move and A to shoot.

Otherwise, use the arrow keys to move and spacebar to shoot.
